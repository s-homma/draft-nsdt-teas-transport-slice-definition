1.  Introduction

   Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical
   partitioning of network resources associated with a service or an
   application.  Network Slicing is considered very useful because there
   is a need to generically describe diverse set of services and related
   resource requirements that can then be applied to any number or type
   of proposed, implemented and/or deployed technologies and associated
   devices.  Some key applications which might benefit from the use of
   network slicing include:

   o  5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See [TS.23.501-3GPP])

   o  Wholesale business VPN

   o  Network infrastructure sharing among the operators

   o  NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)

   A network slice is composed of different endpoints and application
   specific connectivity between them.  Transport slices are components
   of a network slice, which are created and managed with in the scope
   of transport networks (IP, MPLS, GMPLS).

   This document provides a definition of 'transport slice' in IETF, and
   describes considerations for their realization.

3.  High Level Architecture of End-to-End Network Slicing

   An end-2-end (E2E) network slice is a complete network slice that
   provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the
   customer.  A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only
   with in the transport networks.  To illustrate the IETF definitions
   of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network
   shown in Figure 1, where a network operator has an E2E network slice
   that traverses multiple technology-specific networks.  Each of these
   networks might use any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS,
   Fiber-Optics (e.g.  WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON),
   Microwave, etc.

   Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes
   and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of
   technology-specific protocol data units.  The types of nodes used in
   any of these networks may include:

   o  Packet Switches (e.g.  Routers, Bridges)

   o  Application servers

   o  Firewalls

   o  Radio Access Network (RAN) components

   o  Mobile Core components

   o  Microwave transceivers

   o  Optical repeaters

   o  etc.

   Each network may support different technology and an E2E network
   slice is a combination of these networks.  As an example:

   o  Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few
      Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers.

   o  Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2
      switches which may run on top on optical network.

   o  Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive
      Optical Network (PON) switches.

                        Figure 1: E2E network slice

   Referring to Figure 1, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network
   slice, it should create one or more of the following two types of
   artefacts:

   o  Transport slice

   o  Other slice (application logic or other non-IETF slice components)

   Note: defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.

   To further clarify the concept of the E2E network slice, consider the
   network operator-z has various customers.  One of the customers,
   needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network for a service
   (e.g.  CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map etc.) and has a specific
   network SLO requirement (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency
   less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to the
   other side.  This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network
   slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G is the User equipment such
   as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving
   etc. and a typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server,
   IMS etc.

   In Figure 1 we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical
   network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y.  It is important to
   consider that an "E2E network slice" is associated with a customer
   and a service type (e.g.  CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).

   For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its
   CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing
   or collection.  To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z'
   in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than
   10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area.  In this case, a single E2E
   network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of
   NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the
   CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection
   of video data.

   It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service
   types are associated with an E2E network slice.  For instance, an E2E
   network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV but
   another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two
   services for City of NY.

4.  IETF Definition and Scope of Transport slice

4.1.  Transport Slice Definition

   The basic IETF definition of a transport slice is as follows:

   "A transport network slice is an abstract network topology connecting
   a number of endpoints, with expected objectives specified through a
   set of service level objectives (SLO)".

   Note: the term transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet is used
   by many standard organizations but from IETF point of view these
   terms are equivalent.

   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and
   corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.

   Transport slice solution should be technology-agnostic, and the means
   for realization can be chosen depending on several factors such as
   service requirements or specifications of underlaying infrastructure.
   They expose a north bound interface (NBI) to the network slice
   operator, which should be general and not tied to any particular
   technology.  The structure and different characteristics of the
   transport slice are described in the following sections.

4.2.  Overview of Transport Slice Structure

   A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to
   form a logical network.  The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a
   customer as shown in Figure 2.  The endpoints may be user equipment,
   any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), or any network

   service for that matter.  Similarly, connections may be virtual or
   physical links of any type of technology.

                         Figure 2: Transport slice

   Figure 2 illustrates a case where a single transport slice provides
   connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints
   on right-hand side with specific characteristic for SLO (i.e.,
   assuring B/W to atleast x bps and transmission delay to be less than
   y ms).

   As shown in Figure 1, an E2E network slice might have one or more of
   "Transport Slices" and one or more of other slices of any
   combinations.  One of the critical parts of an E2E network slice is
   "Transport Slices" which provides various connections with certain
   SLO between various endpoints.

   A transport slice is built with combination of specific technologies
   on the basis of request from a higher operation system.  The
   interface to higher operation systems should be technology-agnostic,
   and thge systems and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete
   configurations based on the technologies.  The request is represented
   with some indicator such as SLO, and technologies are selected and
   managed according to such requirements.

Internet-Draft draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition   January 2020


   Furthermore, the structure of transport slices can be hierarchical,
   i.e. operationally, a transport slice at one level maybe decomposed
   in two or more transport slices which are then independently realized
   and managed.  This is further described in Section 5.3.

5.  Transport Slice Characteristics

5.1.  Characteristics as Network/Service and SLO

   A transport slice may have some characteristics based on service
   provided on it.  Such characteristics can be represented with
   attributes or several quantifiable objectives such as SLOs.

   Several SDOs has definition of attributes on network services and
   some of them have potencially impact on transport slice
   characteristics.  Analysis of attributes for slices is proceeded in
   [I-D.contreras-teas-slice-nbi].

   SLO is a parameter used widely for deciding objective on network
   quality, and will be useful for representing characteristics of
   transport slice.  A non-exhaustive list of characteristics types for
   transport slice is described below:

   o  Guaranteed Bandwidth

   o  Guaranteed Delay

   o  Prevention of Jitter

   o  High Reliability (i.e., low packet loss rate)

   o  High Availability (i.e., MTBF, MTTR)

   o  Secure network

   o  etc.

   SLA discussion: The scope IETF transport slice definition and its
   control is to provide the transport slice realizing entity with the
   parameters that make up the relevant service details.  In contrast
   the concept of a service level agreement represents a contract for a
   service between a service provider and a service consumer (or
   subscriber), a translation of SLA to SLO is not in the scope of IETF.
   Transport slices concern with parameteric guarantees of the type
   defined above.

   Isolation discussion: SLO sufficiently specify a transport slice.
   For example, an SLO need not explicitely ask for isolation since it



Rokui, et al.             Expires July 10, 2020                 [Page 8]

Internet-Draft draft-nsdt-teas-transport-slice-definition   January 2020


   is implied by guarantees of network resources.  In fact a number of
   isolation technologies (TE, RSVP, VPN, VXLAN, IntServ etc.) are means
   to realize transport slices in the underlay networks.  It is also
   implied that the forwarding, policy and addresse spaces are local
   with in a transport slice and instantiation of one slice does not
   conflict with another slice.  This can be enforced as hard or soft
   level of resource allocations.  The appropriate level is selected on
   the basis of specified SLO.

5.2.  Endpoint Variation

   Transport slice endpoints are the terminating or originating nodes
   requiring connectivity with specific SLO.  Endpoints may be devices
   or functions.

5.2.1.  Types of Endpoints

   There are two types of endpoints based on the functions they perform.

   Transport type EP:  This type of end point performs forwarding
      customer payload without any modification.  E.g. routers,
      switches.

   Service type EP:  This type of endpoint manipulates, process or
      modify the user data payload (based on policies).  A non-
      exhaustive list of service functions includes: firewalls, WAN and
      application acceleration, Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server
      load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header
      enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7
      services" is often used to describe such service functions (SFs).

   This document leverages term Network Function (NF) to represent both
   types of endpoints in draft-ietf-teas-sf-aware-topo-model.

5.2.2.  Connectivity Patterns

   Endpoints may be connected point to point or point to multipoint
   based on the topology requested by the customer.

   o  P2P type of connections are between 2 endpoints like a pseudowire,
      or a logical link.  The interconnections must represent the SLOs
      as requested by the customer.

   o  MP2P type connections will interconnect two or more endpoints
      together, representing an abstract topology or graph.  Under MP2P
      scnearios it shoul be possible for each logical link to have
      different SLO than the other link.

5.3.  Hierarchical Concept on Transport Slice

   Transport slice may follow a hierarchical structure for several
   reasons, such as ease of independent monitoring, control and
   management across different administrative domains and to manage
   scalability better.

      TSnn:  Level 2 hierarchal transport slice nn
      TSn:   Level 1 transport Slice n

                    Figure 3: Transport Slice Hierarchy

   Figure 3 shows transport slice hierarchy.  Slices TS11 and TS12 are
   composed together to form TS1 the top level transport slice
   definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12.  The SLO for
   bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be
   split into latency in networks 2 and 3.  To emphasise the
   hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the
   same administrative domain but use different transport technologies
   SR and L2VPN respectively.  Then instead of presenting 2 transport
   slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12 hiding
   the underlying transport technology details.

      Note: The specification to connect TS121 and TS122 are similar to
      those connecting TS12 and TS11.

6.1.1.  Scenario-1

   Figure 4 depicts an example of transport slice connecting two 5G RAN
   nodes (gNB) to three 5G Core user plan function nodes (UPF).  In this
   case a transport slice 20 is created with SLA including 10 [msec], or
   better, latency between 5G endpoints gNBs and UPFs.

6.1.3.  Scenario-3

   Another example of transport slice is SFC case as shown in Figure 6
   and Figure 7 which depict an example with SF1 and SF2 (e.g.  DPI,
   Firewall, WAF, video optimizer, content cache server, NAT/CGN, Load
   balancer) and the transport slice between ER1 and ER2 traverses these
   SFs.  There are two approaches:

   o  Approach-1 shown in Figure 6 where Transport slice 40 chains
      router ER1, SF1, SF2, and router ER2.  Transport slice 40 needs
      lower than 30 ms delay.  However, endpoints SF1 and SF2 are
      implicitly identified during the transport slice realization.  In
      this case, a single transport slice is created between ER1 and
      ER2.

   o  Approach-2 shown in Figure 7 where the transport slice 40 can be
      broken into transport slices 41, 42, 43.  In this case SF1 and SF2
      are explicityly identified and as a results three transport slices
      between following endpoints will be realized:

      *  Between endpoints ER1 and SF1

      *  Between endpoints SF1 and SF2

      *  Between endpoints SF2 and ER2

6.2.  Considerations on Realization

   A Transport Slice has another aspect which is its realization in the
   operator's network as shown in Figure 8.  The creaton of a new
   Transport Slice will be initiated with follwoing 3 Steps:

   Step 1:  A higher level system requests connections with specific
      characteristics via NBI.

   Step 2:  This request will be processed by a Transport Slice
      Controller which specifies a mapping between northbound request to
      any IETF Services, Tunnels, and paths models.

   Step 3:  A series of requests for creaton of services, tunnels and
      paths will be sent to the network to realize the trasport slice.

                   Figure 8: Transport Slice Realization

6.2.1.  Realization of Scenario-1

   Figure 9 depicts the realization of the transport slice 20 of
   Figure 4.  Operator's transport slice controller invoke an abstract
   API to create a transport slice between 5G endpoints gNB1 and gNB2 to
   5G Core endpoints UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 with SLA inlcuding 10 [ms]
   latency.

   Since in most cases the passed in endpoints (i.e. 5G RAN and 5G Core
   endpoints) cannot support any IP/MPLS/Optics services, the endpoints
   to realize the transport slice 20 will not be the endpoints passed
   in.  This is one of the most important aspects to consider when
   realizing the transport slices.

   As shown in Figure 9, the realization of transport slice 20 required
   the transport slice controller to find out the "best" endpoints which
   support the realization of transport slice 20 in the network, i.e.
   endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.  After that, the realization of the
   transport slice 20 will be initiated by creation of various
   services/tunnels/paths between edge routers ER1, ER2 and ER3.  The
   type of Services/Tunnels/Paths depends on the supported technologies
   of endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.

   In this scenario, the end points of transport slice realization are
   not those endpoints passed in, i.e.

   o  Definition of transport slice is between gNB1 and gNB2 to UPF1,
      UPF2, and UPF3

          Figure 9: Realization of Transport slice 20 of Figure 3

6.2.2.  Realization of Scenario-2

   Figure 10 depicts the realization of transport slice 30 of Figure 5.
   Operator's Transport Slice Controller receives a request to create a
   transport slice between network functions R1 and firewalls FW1 and
   FW2 with SLO including 5 [Mbps].  Depends on the underlying network
   topology, Operator's transport slice controller will realize the
   transport slice.  For example, if both network functions (i.e.  R1,
   FW1, FW2) and network supports segment routing, two Tunnels/Services
   of type SR can be created (or used) in the network between R1, FW1
   and FW2 to realise the transport slice 30.  However, if the network
   just supports RSVP, two tunnels/services of type RSVP can be used to
   realize this transport slice.

   Note that since the network functions ER1, FW1 and FW2 support
   segment routing, the endpoints of the tunnels in this example are

   those endpointss passed in, i.e. the endpoints of the both transport
   slice definiton and its realization are R1, FW1 and FW2:

   o  Definition of transport slice is between network functions R1 to
      FW1 and FW2

   o  Realization of transport slice is between network functions R1 to
      FW1 and FW2

   We will see in next example that in some scenarios this is not the
   case and the endpoints of Transport Slice definition might be
   different from endpoints of its realization of transport slices.

   It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized
   in the network (i.e. using tunnels of type RSVP or SR), the
   definition of transport slice 30 does not change at all but rather
   its realization.

   and R2 across SF1 and SF2.  However, the location of SF1 and SF2 are

   decided internally with a logic in Transport Slice Controller.  For
   example, when SLA requires the high secure transport slice between
   ER1 and ER2 which in turn results on adding SF1 and SF2 to the
   realization of transport slice 40 implicitly by transport slice
   controller.

   Figure 12 shows the realization of the transport slice 40 of
   Figure 7.  In this case the location of SF1 and SF2 has been
   explicitly decided by higher level logic.  In this case three
   transport slices 41, 42 and 43 will be created separately and
   eventually bind together to form a single transport slice 40 to meet
   the SLA that delay is lower than 30 ms.
