    <section title="Introduction">
	<!-- SH-28Jan:  modified the following text for  emphasizing  benefitial features of network slicing. -->
    	<t>
       Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical partitioning of network resources  
       associated with a service or an application. Network slicing is expected to enable diverse 
       devices/applications which have different requirements on communication to coexist on the same network 
       efficiently. Also, a network slice sometimes traverses multiple domains, and generalized interfaces, 
       operations, and managements would be important.  
       </t>

       <t>
       Some key applications which might benefit from the 
       use of network slicing include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among the operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)</t>
        </list>
       </t>

     <t>
      A 'network slice' is composed of different endpoints, application logic and specific connectivity between them. 
      Transport slices are a part of network slice that fulfills connection requirements between endpoints. Transport slices 
      are created and managed within the scope of transport networks (e.g. IP, MPLS, optical). 
      </t>
      <t>
      This document provides a definition of slice in transport network (called "transport slice"), and describes its characteristics.

    <section title="High Level Description of End-to-End Network Slicing">

    <!-- SH-28Jan: We need polish this section and eliminate the superfluous-->
      <t>
        An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a specific 
        assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only within the transport networks.
        To illustrate the IETF definitions of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, 
        where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use 
        any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
       Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific 
       protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet Switches (e.g., Routers, Bridges)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core components</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top on an optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>


      <t>
      Referring to <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it should create 
      one or more of transport slices and other slices (application logic or other network function instances).
      </t> 
      
      <t>
       Note:  defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.
      </t>

<!-- SH-29Jan: E2E slice is not our main target, and the following example can be removed.
      <t>
    To further clarify the concept of E2E network slice, consider the network operator-z has various 
    customers. One of the customers, needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network 
    for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) and has a specific network SLO requirement 
    (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to 
    the other side. This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G 
    is the User equipment such as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving etc. and a 
    typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/> we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical 
    network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y. It is important to consider that an "E2E network slice" is 
    associated with a customer and a service type (e.g. CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).
      </t>

      <t>
    For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.
    
         KM: some issues here. This example seems not very accurate
        I can see what you want to say but CCTV as a service is just video streaming service, it can be used by
        NYPD or traffic police for public safety and traffic violation - 2 different services
          I suggest to comment this line below for now. Later we should talk about service types - then add more.
        
    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV 
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for City of NY.
      </t>

    <section title="Definition and Scope of Transport slice">
<!-- SH-23dec: This definition is not for as term but for as transport slice itself, and I'd like return this sub title to original one.-->
      <section title="Transport Slice Definition">

        <t>
    The basic definition of a transport slice is as follows:
      </t>
        <t>
        "A transport slice is an abstract network topology connecting a number of endpoints, with expected objectives specified through a set of service level objectives (SLO)".
      </t>
    
        <t>
		Note: The term sub-slice or slice-subnet is used by many standard organizations 
		to refer to "Transport Slice" or "Other Slice" (i.e. transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet).
		From IETF point of view these terms are all equivalent. We will use term "slice" in this document (i.e. use transport slice)
       </t>
    
       
    <!-- SH: I think a definition about minimum unit of slice is needed before this text. Also I assume it may vary depending on view points such as realization, management, or tenant aspects.
      <t>
	Note that the Transport slice (or "Other Slice") is the minimum unit structure of an e2e network slice. 
      </t>
    -->
        <t>
	   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.
      </t>

    <!-- SH-23dec: I think what is technology-agnostic is transport slice concept or its structure, not definition. "Technology-agnostic" is "defined" here. -->
    <!-- SH-07Jan: I'd like to propose to use word "solution" instead of "definition" here. How about it? -->
        <t>
			Transport slice should be technology-agnostic, and the means for realization can be chosen 
			depending on several factors such as service requirements, specifications or capabilities 
			of underlaying infrastructure. The structure and different characteristics of the transport slice 
			are described in the following  sections.
       </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Overview of Transport Slice Structure">    
       <t>
        A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to form a logical network. The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a customer 
        as shown in  <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/>. The endpoints may be user equipment, any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), 
        or any network service for that matter. Similarly,  connections may be virtual or physical links of any type of technology.  
       </t>

<!-- SH: I attatched new fiture for presenting transport slice as below. 
         If this is better than old one, I can change other figures.

      <t>
      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where a single transport 
      slice provides connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints on right-hand side with specific 
      characteristic for SLO (i.e., assuring B/W to at least x bps and transmission delay to be less than y ms). 
      </t>

      <t>
      As shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, an E2E network slice might have one or more of "Transport Slices" 
      and one or more of "Other Slices" of any combinations. The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with certain
      SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization addresses its implementation using various technologies.
      In short, the structure of a transport slice involves both definition and its realization.
      </t>

	
	<t> A "transport slice" addresses a set of technology-agnostic connections between various 
		endpoints with certain SLOs.  The managing entity or operating stakeholder of a transport slice is 
		called a Slice operator. 
    </t> 

<!-- SH-29Jan: The following text seems redundant, and I shaped up this. Also, I added introduction of VPN+ as a reference. -->
   <t>
       Transport slice can be realized by using  specific technologies in the operator's network.  
       Soem technology sets for realizing a transport slice are introduced in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/>.
       A transport slice may be realized by allocating appropriate resources into 
	   one or more networks. The managing entity realizing a transport slice is  
		referred to as realizing network operator in this document. </t>

   <t>
		A transport slice is built with a combination of specific technologies on the basis of request from 
		a higher operations system.  The interface to higher operations systems should be technology-agnostic, 
		and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete configurations based on the 
		technologies. The request to instantiate a transport slice is represented with some indicators 
		such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed accordingly.
    </t>

	<t>Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be hierarchical, i.e. operationally, 
			 a transport slice at one  level maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then 
			independently realized and managed. This is further described in <xref target="Hierarchical-Concept"/>.</t>

		 <t> The above stakeholders help to clearly define the scope and type of interfaces necessary to deploy, 
			 monitor and manage transport slices. The interface between a transport slice controller and network controller(s) 
			 has to be technology-agnostic, in order to generalize deployment of different types of network slice services. 
			 Whereas the interface from a network 
			 controller to the infrastructure may be diverse to support a variety of underlying transport technologies.
			 
			 Thus, scope of two types of interfaces are defined as follows:

		 <t hangText="TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):">
			 The TSC Northbound Interface is a bidirectional interface between 'A higher level system (e.g. E2E network slice orchestrator)'

			 and links . Additionally, operations to augment and monitor those transport slices are also supported over NBI.
		 </t>
		 <t hangText="TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):">
			 The TSC Southbound interface is a bidirectional interface between 'Transport slice controller' and network controller(s).

			  SLA discussion: The scope IETF transport slice definition and its control is to provide the transport slice realizing 
			  entity with the parameters that make up the relevant service details.  In contrast 
			  the concept of a service level agreement represents a contract for a service between a service provider 
			  and a service consumer (or subscriber), a translation of SLA to SLO  is not in the scope of IETF. 
			  Transport slices concern with parametric guarantees of the type defined above.

        <!-- SH-23dec: Isolation is a key factor of network slicing, and the treatment in IETF transport slice should be described

		   <t> 
			   Isolation discussion: SLO sufficiently specifies a transport slice. For example, an SLO 
			   need not explicitly ask for 
			   isolation since it is implied by guarantees of network resources. In fact a number of isolation 
			   technologies (TE, RSVP, VPN, VXLAN, IntServ etc.) are means to realize transport slices in the 
			   underlay networks. It is also implied that the forwarding, policy and address spaces are local 
			   with in a transport slice and instantiation of one slice does not conflict with another slice. 
			   This can be enforced as hard or soft level of resource allocations. The appropriate level is selected 
			   based on the specified SLOs.

        <section anchor="Hierarchical-Concept" title="Vertical Transport Slice">
        <t>
			Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relation that may provide a vertical structure to it. This is used 
			for  building multi-layer slices and each layer providing its own independent 
			monitoring, performance, control and management of resources. 
			The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in 2 forms:
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t> The Transport slice itself where it represents hierarchy of abstracted transport slices. In this case realization 
				  will done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in the hierarchy that 
				  can not be decomposed further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized transport slice.</t>
			 <t> Since a transport slice is a set of resources, not just VPN or 
				 TE tunnel, the realization of a transport slice may be also hierarchical. This type of multi-layer vertical 
				 transport slice associates resources at different layers. For example, an IP transport slice
				 would utilize one or more optical transport slice.  In this case realization 
				will done for  a particular technology at that layer. Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of hierarchy that 
				can not be decomposed further will be an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.</t>

Slices TS11 and TS12 are composed together to form TS1 the top level transport slice definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12. The SLO for bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be split into latency in networks 2 and 3. To emphasize the hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the same administrative domain but use different transport technologies SR and L2VPN respectively. Then instead of presenting 2 transport slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12 hiding the underlying transport technology details.
		<list style="empty">

      </section>
      <section title="Horizonal Composition of Transport slice">
	<t> In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable composition of multiple realized transport slices. Since transport slices 
		are not necessarily single tunnel and may traverse through differnt data planes, each realized transport slice will require 
		a stitching or mapping function. These stitching functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function endpoints. 
		For instance in <xref target="fig_HNS"/>, TS11 and TS12 are horizonal transport slices. If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in figure) is needed for translation.

	Author's notes: This  service type EP is  new type of transport slice specific service function. We may call it transport slice
	gateway.
