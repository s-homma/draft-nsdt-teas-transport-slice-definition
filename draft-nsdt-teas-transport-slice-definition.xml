    <section title="Introduction">
	<!-- SH-28Jan:  modified the following text for  emphasizing  benefitial features of network slicing. -->
    	<t>
       Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical partitioning of network resources  
       associated with a service or an application. Network slicing is expected to enable diverse 
       devices/applications which have different requirements on communication to coexist on the same network 
       efficiently. Also, a network slice sometimes traverses multiple domains, and generalized interfaces, 
       operations, and managements would be important.  
       </t>

       <t>
       Some key applications which might benefit from the 
       use of network slicing include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>
          <t>Network wholesale</t>
          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among the operators</t>
          <t>NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)</t>
        </list>
       </t>

     <t>
      A 'network slice' is composed of different endpoints, application logic and specific connectivity between them. 
      Transport slices are a part of network slice that fulfills connection requirements between endpoints. Transport slices 
      are created and managed within the scope of transport networks (e.g. IP, MPLS, optical). 
      </t>
      <t>
      This document provides a definition of slice in transport network (called "transport slice"), and describes its characteristics.

    <section title="High Level Description of End-to-End Network Slicing">

    <!-- SH-28Jan: We need polish this section and eliminate the superfluous-->
      <t>
        An end-to-end (E2E) network slice is a complete logical network that provides a service in its entirety with a specific 
        assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only within the transport networks.
        To illustrate the IETF definitions of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, 
        where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use 
        any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
       Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific 
       protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet Switches (e.g., Routers, Bridges)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Service Functions(e.g., Firewall, Loadbalancer)</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core components</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technologies and an E2E network slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top on an optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>


      <t>
      Referring to <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it should create 
      one or more of transport slices and other slices (application logic or other network function instances).
      </t> 
      
      <t>
       Note:  defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.
      </t>
      <t>
    To further clarify the concept of E2E network slice, consider the network operator-z has various 
    customers. One of the customers, needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network 
    for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map, etc.) and has a specific network SLO requirement 
    (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to 
    the other side. This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G 
    is the User equipment such as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving etc. and a 
    typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/> we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical 
    network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y. It is important to consider that an "E2E network slice" is 
    associated with a customer and a service type (e.g. CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).
      </t>

      <t>
    For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.
    
    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV 
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for City of NY.
      </t>
    </section>


    <section title="Definition and Scope of Transport slice">
      <section title="Transport Slice Definition">

        <t>
    The basic definition of a transport slice is as follows:
      </t>
        <t>
        "A transport slice is an abstract network topology connecting a number of endpoints, with expected objectives specified through a set of service level objectives (SLO)".
      </t>
    
        <t>
		Note: The term sub-slice or slice-subnet is used by many standard organizations 
		to refer to "Transport Slice" or "Other Slice" (i.e. transport sub-slice or transport slice-subnet).
		From IETF point of view these terms are all equivalent. We will use term "slice" in this document (i.e. use transport slice)
       </t>
    
   
        <t>
	   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.
      </t>
        <t>
			Transport slice should be technology-agnostic, and the means for realization can be chosen 
			depending on several factors such as service requirements, specifications or capabilities 
			of underlaying infrastructure. The structure and different characteristics of the transport slice 
			are described in the following  sections.
       </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Transport Slice Structure">    
       <t>
        A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to form a logical network. The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a customer 
        as shown in  <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/>. The endpoints may be user equipment, any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), 
        or any network service for that matter. Similarly,  connections may be virtual or physical links of any type of technology.  
       </t>

<!-- SH: I attatched new fiture for presenting transport slice as below. 
         If this is better than old one, I can change other figures.

      <t>
      <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where a single transport 
      slice provides connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints on right-hand side with specific 
      characteristic for SLO (i.e., assuring B/W to at least x bps and transmission delay to be less than y ms). 
      </t>

      <t>
      As shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, an E2E network slice might have one or more of "Transport Slices" 
      and one or more of "Other Slices" of any combinations. The "Transport Slices" provides various connections with certain
      SLO between various endpoints whereas the transport slice realization addresses its implementation using various technologies.
      In short, the structure of a transport slice involves both definition and its realization.
      </t>

	
	<t> A "transport slice" addresses a set of technology-agnostic connections between various 
		endpoints with certain SLOs.  The managing entity or operating stakeholder of a transport slice is 
		called a Transport Slice Controller. 
    </t> 

<!-- SH-29Jan: The following text seems redundant, and I shaped up this. Also, I added introduction of VPN+ as a reference. -->
   <t>
       Transport slice realization uses specific technologies in the operator's network.  
       The realization may require allocating appropriate resources into one or more networks and a mapping to transport slice. The managing entity realizing a transport slice is  
		referred to as network controller. </t>

   <t>
		A transport slice is built on the basis of request from a higher operations system.  The interface to higher operations 
		systems should be technology-agnostic, 
		and slice customers don't need to recognize concrete configurations based on the 
		technologies. The request to instantiate a transport slice is represented with some indicators 
		such as SLO, and technologies are selected and managed accordingly.
    </t>

	<t>Furthermore, the structure of transport slices may be layered vertically or composed horizontally, i.e. operationally, 
			 a transport slice maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then 
			independently realized and managed. This is further described in <xref target="Vertical-Concept"/>.</t>

	 	<section anchor="actors" title="Stakeholders">
			<t> A transport slice and its realization involves the following stakeholders and it is relevant 
				to define them for consistent terminology.
	   	<list style="hanging">

				 maintains and monitors the run-time state of resources and topologies associated with it.
				A standard interface is needed between different type of The transport slice controller and different types 
				of orchestrator. 
			</t>
			<t hangText="Transport Network Controller:">
				A transport network controller is traditional network infrastructure 
				controller that offers network resources to TSC to be used for realization of a particular 
				transport slice. These are existing network controllers for a specific technology to 
				realize transport slices in its network.</t>

		 <t> The above stakeholders help to clearly define the scope and type of interfaces necessary to deploy, 
			 monitor and manage transport slices. The interface between a transport slice controller and network controller(s) 
			 has to be technology-agnostic, in order to generalize deployment of different types of network slice services. 
			 Whereas the interface from a network 
			 controller to the infrastructure may be diverse to support a variety of underlying transport technologies.
			 
			 Thus, scope of two types of interfaces are defined as follows:

	   	<list style="hanging">
		 <t hangText="TSC Northbound Interface (NBI):">
			 The TSC Northbound Interface is a bidirectional interface between a higher level system, e.g. 'E2E network slice orchestrator' 
			 and the 'Transport slice controller'.  Differnt types of orchestrators will have
			 a common interface to transport slices through NBI.  Operations to create, delete, augment and monitor for service assurance of 
			 those transport slices should be supported through NBI.
		 </t>
		 <t hangText="TSC Southbound Interface (SBI):">
			 The TSC Southbound interface is a bidirectional interface between 'Transport slice controller' and network controller(s).
			 These interfaces are technology-specific and can utilize many of the existing data models 
			 such as L2SM, L3SM, VPN etc. They may need extensions to provide additional operations to 
			 match NBI operations mentioned above. The TSC maintains mappings to network and connectivity resources allocated by one or many network controllers.

        <t> 
			A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable objectives or SLOs. These objectives define a set of 
			network resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service a given transport slice. A non-exhaustive 
		   list of characteristics types for transport slice is described below:
            <list style="symbols">
             <t>Guaranteed Bandwidth</t>

		   <t> 
			  SLA vs SLO discussion: In defining transport slices, the term  SLO instead of SLA is used even though SLAs are more commonly
			  used term by the operators. SLOs are definitve and measureable parameters associated with a
			  service, therefore, network resource and connectivity requirements are defined accurately. In contrast 
			   service level agreements represent contracts for a service between a service provider 
			  and a service consumer (or subscriber). Providers then translate SLA into SLO; these translations vary from one service provider to the other. 
			  Therefore, all through with in the scope of transport slices term SLOs will be used. 
		   </t>

		   <t> 
			   Isolation discussion: There was difference of opinion whether isolation should be explicitely demanded 
			   by a transport slice as an SLO. However, as long as the primary SLOs such as bandwidth, latency, throughput, path-selection, encryption, 
			   security etc. meet the functionality of a transport slice, it is not necessary to explicitly ask for isolation. 
			   We are also aware several underlying technologies (e.g.  tunnels) inherently support isolation so it can be an 
			   implementation requirement not definition.

				Deep Packet Inspection (DPI), server load balancers, NAT44 [RFC3022], NAT64 [RFC6146], HTTP header 
				enrichment functions, and TCP optimizers.  The generic term "L4-L7 services" is often used to 
				describe such service functions (SFs).

        <section anchor="Vertical-Concept" title="Vertical Transport Slice">
        <t>
			Transport slice may follow a hierarchical relation that may provide a vertical structure to it. This is used 
			for  building multi-layer slices in which each layer provides its own abstraction as well as independent 
			monitoring, performance, control and management of resources. 
			The vertical transport slice characteristic maybe used in 2 forms:
			<list style="symbols">
			  <t> The Transport slice itself where it represents hierarchy of abstracted transport slices. In this case realization 
				  will done just once with a particular technology.  Thus, the lowest transport slice in the hierarchy that 
				  can not be decomposed further will be one to one mapping to its instance of realized transport slice.</t>
			  <t> Each layer (physical, datalink, or IP) has its own set of resources that  can be provided to upper layer as a transport slice. Thus, transport slice at one layer can be be used by the layer above. This type of 
				  multi-layer vertical 
				 transport slice associates resources at different layers. For example, an IP transport slice
				 would utilize one or more optical transport slice.  In this case realization 
				will done for  a particular technology at that layer. Thus, the lowest transport slice in this type of hierarchy that 
				can not be decomposed further will be an instance of realized physical layer transport slice.</t>

Slices TS11 and TS12 are composed together to form TS1 the top level transport slice definition, TS121 and TS122 collectively define TS12. The SLO for bandwidth guarantee will be shared and latency guarantee will be split into latency in networks 2 and 3. To emphasize the hierarchical structure, consider Network-2 and Network-3 are in the same administrative domain but use different transport technologies SR and L2VPN respectively. Then instead of presenting 2 transport slices, Operator-z can expose only one transport slice TS12 hiding the underlying transport technology details.
		<list style="empty">

      </section>
      <section title="Horizontal Composition of Transport slice">
	<t> In contrast, horizontal transport slices enable composition of multiple realized transport slices. Since transport slices 
		are not necessarily single tunnel and may traverse through differnt data planes, each realized transport slice will require 
		a stitching or mapping function. These stitching functions can be viewed as a type of intermediate network function endpoints. 
		For instance in <xref target="fig_HNS"/>, TS11 and TS12 are horizonal transport slices. If we assume that TS11 is an L2 tunnel and TS12 is an SRV6 based path, then a 'Service type EP' (not shown in figure) is needed for translation.
    </t>
    <t>
	Author's notes: This  service type EP is  new type of transport slice specific service function. We may call it transport slice
	gateway.

 <section title="Realization of Transport slice">
	 <t>
	 Realization of a Transport Slice is its integral part and is created and maintained over south bound interfaces. Since realization of transport slice is technology specific, it is handled by the network controller which also exports these mappings to the TSC. During realization resources are actually allocated leading to instantiation of a transport slice in the network. Network controller hides the details of underlying resources from the TSC and exports, logical handles to those resources.
 </t> <t>
	 Realization may be achieved in the form of describing either physical, logical, or overlay connectivity through VPNs, tunnels, segment routing, SFC, etc. Accordingly end points may be realized as physical or logical service or network functions. As an example, a possible candidate technology for building transport slices is described in <xref target="I-D.ietf-teas-enhanced-vpn"/>.
