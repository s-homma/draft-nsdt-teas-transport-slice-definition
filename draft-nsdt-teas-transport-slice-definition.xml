    <section title="Introduction">
		<t>
      Network slicing is a methodology to generically describe the logical partitioning 
      of network resources  associated with a service or an application. Network Slicing is considered very useful because there is a need to generically describe 
      diverse set of services and related resource requirements that can then be applied to
      any number or type of proposed, implemented and/or deployed technologies and associated
      devices. Some key applications which might benefit from the use of network slicing include:
        <list style="symbols">
          <t>5G services (e.g. eMBB, URLLC, mMTC)(See <xref target="TS.23.501-3GPP"/>)</t>

          <t>Network infrastructure sharing among the operators</t><t>NFV connectivity (Data Center Interconnect)</t>
        </list>
      <!-- KM: I am confused here. Do you want to say this for network transport slice or network slice in general?-->
      A network slice is composed of different endpoints and application specific connectivity between them. Transport slices are components of a network slice, which are created and managed with in the scope of transport networks (IP, MPLS, GMPLS). 
      </t>

      This document provides a definition of 'transport slice' in IETF, and describes considerations for their realization.

    <section title="High Level Architecture of End-to-End Network Slicing">
      <t>
        An end-2-end (E2E) network slice is a complete network slice that provides a service in its entirety with a specific assurance to the customer. A transport slice concerns those assurance aspects only with in the transport networks.

    To illustrate the IETF definitions of both E2E network slice and transport slice, consider the network shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, where a network operator has an E2E network slice that traverses multiple technology-specific networks. Each of these networks might use any number of technologies, including IP, MPLS, Fiber-Optics (e.g. WDM, DWDM), Passive Optical Networking (PON), Microwave, etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    Each of these networks includes multiple (physical or virtual) nodes and may also provide network functions beyond simply carrying of technology-specific protocol data units. The types of nodes used in any of these networks may include:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Packet Switches (e.g. Routers, Bridges)</t>
        <t>Application servers</t>
        <t>Firewalls</t>
        <t>Radio Access Network (RAN) components</t>
        <t>Mobile Core components</t>
        <t>Microwave transceivers</t>
        <t>Optical repeaters</t>
        <t>etc.</t></list>
      </t>
      <t>
    Each network may support different technology and an E2E network slice is a combination of these networks. As an example:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Network 1 might contain multiple 5G RAN nodes connected to a few Cell Site Gateways (CSG) routers. </t>
        <t>Network 2 might have one or more layer-3 routers and layer-2 switches which may run on top on optical network.</t>
        <t>Network 3 might have a few 5G RAN nodes connecting to Passive Optical Network (PON) switches.</t>
        </list>
      </t>

  ]]></artwork>
      </figure>


      <t>
      Referring to <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, when operator-z creates a specific E2E network slice, it should create 
      one or more of the following two types of artefacts:
      <list style="symbols">
        <t>Transport slice</t>
        <t>Other slice (application logic or other non-IETF slice components)</t>
        </list>
	  </t>
      
      <t>
       Note:  defining the other slices is out-of-scope of the current work.
      </t>

      <t>
    To further clarify the concept of the E2E network slice, consider the network operator-z has various 
    customers. One of the customers, needs a separate and an independent E2E logical network 
    for a service (e.g. CCTV, autonomous driving, HD map etc.) and has a specific network SLO requirement 
    (e.g. a secure connection with an E2E latency less than 5ms) from End User-x (EU-x) to End User-y (EU-y) to 
    the other side. This E2E logical network is called an "E2E network slice".  A typical example of EU-x in 5G 
    is the User equipment such as infotainment unit in the car, CCTV, Car for autonomous driving etc. and a 
    typical example of EU-y in 5G is 5G application server, IMS etc.
      </t>
      <t>
    In <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/> we use the term "E2E network slice" to show the logical 
    network with requested SLO for EU-x to EU-y. It is important to consider that an "E2E network slice" is 
    associated with a customer and a service type (e.g. CCTV service, autonomous driving etc.).
      </t>

      <t>
        <!--KM: I think entire city is too large, you can say an area or zone -->
    For example, a customer "City of NY" would like to connect all its CCTV cameras for the entire city to one or more locations for viewing or collection. To this end, it requests local carrier - 'operator-z' in NY to create a new E2E network slice with a bandwidth no-less-than 10Mbps from each CCTV coverage area. In this case, a single E2E network slice will be created by the operator-z for customer "City of NY", service type of CCTV and requested bandwidth connecting all the CCTV camera zones to one or more control-centers for the collection of video data.
      </t>
      <t>
    It may also be possible that more than one customer and/or service types are associated with an E2E network slice.
        <!-- KM: some issues here. This example seems not very accurate
        I can see what you want to say but CCTV as a service is just video streaming service, it can be used by
        NYPD or traffic police for public safety and traffic violation - 2 different services
          I suggest to comment this line below for now. Later we should talk about service types - then add more.
        -->
    For instance, an E2E network slice is associated with not only to service type CCTV 
    but another service "Public Safety", i.e. NS ID 10 is used for two services for City of NY.

    <section title="IETF Definition and Scope of Transport slice">
<!-- SH-23dec: This definition is not for as term but for as transport slice itself, and I'd like return this sub title to original one.-->
      <section title="Defining Transport Slice">
        <t>
    The basic IETF definition of a transport slice is as follows:
      </t>
        <t>
        "A transport network slice is an abstract network topology connecting a number of endpoints, with expected objectives specified through a set of service level objectives (SLO)".
      </t>
        <t>
        Note: the term transport sub-slice or transport 
		slice-subnet is used by many standard organizations but from IETF point of view these terms are equivalent.
       </t>
       
    <!-- SH: I think a definition about minimum unit of slice is needed before this text. Also I assume it may vary depending on view points such as realization, management, or tenant aspects.
      <t>
	Note that the Transport slice (or "Other Slice") is the minimum unit structure of an e2e network slice. 
      </t>
    -->
        <t>
	   SLOs are used to clearly describe different network resources and corresponding parameters necessary to realize the transport slice.
      </t>

    <!-- SH-23dec:  I think what is technology-agnostic is transport slice concept or its structure, not definition. "Technology-agnostic" is "defined" here. -->
        <t>
        Transport slice <!--definition--> should be technology-agnostic, and the means for realization are chosen depending on the requirements.  
         They expose a north bound interface (NBI) to the network slice operator, which should be general 
        and not  tied to any particular technology. The structure and different characteristics of the transport slice are described in the following  sections. 
        <!--<xref target="TS-Char"/>.-->
       </t>
      </section>

      <section title="Overview of Transport Slice Structure">    
       <t>
        A transport slice has a set of connections and various endpoints to form a logical network. The goal is to achieve specific SLO for a customer 
        as shown in  <xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/>. The endpoints may be user equipment, any physical or virtual network functions (PNF/VNF), 
        or any network service for that matter. Similarly,  connections may be virtual or physical links of any type of technology.  
       </t>

<!-- SH: I attatched new fiture for presenting transport slice as below. 
         If this is better than old one, I can change other figures.

      <t><xref target="fig_Transport-NS"/> illustrates a case where a single transport 
      slice provides connectivity between "m" endpoints on left-hand side to "n" endpoints on right-hand side with specific 
      characteristic for SLO (i.e., assuring B/W to atleast x bps and transmission delay to be less than y ms). 
      </t>

      <t>
     As shown in <xref target="fig_E2E-NS"/>, an E2E network slice might have one or more of "Transport Slices" 
     and one or more of other slices of any combinations. One of the critical parts of an E2E network slice is 
     "Transport Slices" which provides various connections with certain SLO between various endpoints. 
      </t>
        <!-- SH: I'd like to introduce hierarchical concept in definition description. -->

        <!-- SH-23dec:  Your word "definition" here seems to be different from general definition. I.e., definition generally 
        defines what something is, and it's strange to use word "definition" in explanation of definitoin. Can you elaborate 
        what is "definition" here? (In my memory, you explained this in discussion with email but unfortunately I lost the email...)
        Or,  I think that the main content in this paragraph can be explained without using "definition".  -->
        <t>
		The structure of a transport slice involves a description and its realization. The "transport slice" 
		addresses a set of technology-agnostic connections between various endpoints with certain SLO. The managing entity or 
		operating stakeholder of a transport slice is called a Slice operator. </t> 
	<t>
		The "transport slice realization" is use of a specific technology to realize the SLOs in the operator's network. 
		 While the definition itself is technology agnostic, its realization 
		is technology specific. A transport slice definition may be realized by allocating appropriate 
		resources into one or more networks. The managing entiry realizing a transport slice are  
		referred to as realizing network operator in this document (or network operator for short). The network oeprators own 
		network infrastructure and allocate resources necessary to realize transport slices. </t>
		
		<t> The roles of slice operator and network operator, and the scope of operations they may perform 
			will be one of the core contribution of transport slice framework.  In their respective roles slice operator and network operator are required to perform several operations
		necessary to administer and manage transport slices and their realization. To be clear, a network operator can 
		also be a slice oeprator; i.e. it offers resources mapped to realize a transport slice as well as provides transport slice 
		to customer.
		</t>
		
		<t>Furthermore, the structure of transport slices can be hierarchical, i.e. operationally, 
			 a transport slice at one  level maybe decomposed in two or more transport slices which are then 
			independently described or "realized". This is further described in <xref target="Hierarchical-Concept"/>.</t>

        <!-- SH-23dec: Explanations about "realizing network operator" and "slice operator" is needed. And I think later sentence can be removed. 
        (I'm not sure yet whether existing technologies are enough for tranport slice. Also, NBI is not mentioned in this document.)-->
      <t>
		  Northbound interfaces (NBIs) are exposed by the 'realizing network operator' to the slice operator defining transport slice. While several technologies are already supported for the realization of transport slice, the NBI common description is new and an important part of the transport slice structure.

        <section title="Service Level Objectives on Transport Slice">
        <t> 
			A transport slice is defined in terms of several quantifiable objectives or SLOs. These objectives define a set of network resource parameters or values necessary to provide a service 
			a given transport slice. A non-exhaustive 
		   list of characteristics types for transport slice is described below:
            <list style="symbols">
             <t>Guaranteed Bandwidth</t>
             <t>Guaranteed Delay</t>
             <t>Prevention of Jitter</t>
             <t>High Reliability (i.e., low packet loss rate)</t>
             <t>High Availability (i.e., MTBF, MTTR)</t>

			  SLA discussion: The scope IETF transport slice definition and its control is to provide the transport slice realizing 
			  entity with the parameters that make up the relevant service details.  In contrast 
			  the concept of a service level agreement represents a contract for a service between a service provider 
			  and a service consumer (or subscriber), a translation of SLA to SLO  is not in the scope of IETF. 
			  Transport slices concern with parameteric guarantees of the type defined above. 
		   </t>

        <!-- SH-23dec: Isolation is a key factor of network slicing, and the treatment in IETF transport slice should be described 
        as dedicated section, not in just memo.-->

		   <t> 
			   Isolation discussion: SLO sufficiently specify a transport slice. For example, an SLO 
			   need not explicitely ask for 
			   isolation since it is implied by guarantees of network resources. In fact a number of isolation 
			   technologies (TE, RSVP, VPN, VXLAN, IntServ etc.) are means to realize transport slices in the 
			   underlay networks. It is also implied that the forwarding, policy and addresse spaces are local 
			   with in a transport slice and instantiation of one slice does not conflict with another slice. 
			   This can be enforced as hard or soft level of resource allocations. The appropriate level is selected 
			   on the basis of specified SLO.

        <!-- SH-23dec: What we need clarify here is why tranport slice can have hierarchical structure, and 
        I assume that the reasons should be elaborated more. 
        Also, I'm wondering whether this hierarchical concept should be considered indepenent of realization. 
        Transport slice is a set of resources, not just VPN or TE tunnel, and the realization may be also hierarchical. 
        (And, if we decide that hierarchy is not used for realization, we need to modify the SFC part in the realization section.)-->

        <t>
		Transport slice definition may follow a hierarchical structure for several reasons, such as ease of 
		independent monitoring, control and management across different administrative domains and to manage 
		scalability better. This characteristic should be used for definition not for realization since 
		realization done with technology awareness. Thus, most basic transport slice definition, that can not be 
		decomposed further will be 1:1 mapped with its realization.

Operator's transport slice controller invoke an abstract API to create a transport slice between 5G endpoints gNB1 and gNB2 to 5G Core endpoints UPF1, UPF2 and UPF3 with SLA inlcuding 10 [ms] latency. 
        </t>
        <t>
      Since in most cases the passed in endpoints (i.e. 5G RAN and 5G Core endpoints) cannot support any IP/MPLS/Optics services, the endpoints to realize the transport slice 20 will not be the endpoints passed in. This is one of the most important aspects to consider when realizing the transport slices.

        <t>
      As shown in <xref target="fig_Imple-5G-Transport-NS"/>, the realization of transport slice 20 required the transport slice 
      controller to find out the "best" endpoints which support the realization of transport slice 20 in the
      network, i.e. endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3. After that, the realization of the transport slice 
      20 will be initiated by creation of various services/tunnels/paths between edge routers ER1,
      ER2 and ER3. The type of Services/Tunnels/Paths depends on the supported technologies of endpoints ER1, ER2 and ER3.

        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-Transport-NS"/> depicts the realization of transport 
      slice 30 of <xref target="fig_FW-Transport-NS"/>. Operator's Transport Slice Controller receives a request to create a 
      transport slice between network functions R1 and firewalls FW1 and FW2 with SLO including 5 [Mbps]. 
      Depends on the underlying network topology, Operator's transport slice controller will realize the transport slice. For example, if both network functions (i.e. R1, FW1, FW2) 
      and network supports segment routing, two Tunnels/Services of type SR can be created (or used) in the 
      network between R1, FW1 and FW2 to realise the transport slice 30. However, if the network just supports
      RSVP, two tunnels/services of type RSVP can be used to realize this transport slice. 
        </t>
        <t>
      Note that since the network functions ER1, FW1 and FW2 support segment routing, the endpoints of 
      the tunnels in this example are those endpointss passed in, i.e. the endpoints of the both transport slice definiton and its realization are R1, FW1 and FW2:
      <list style="symbols"><t>Definition of transport slice is between network functions R1 to FW1 and FW2</t><t>Realization of transport slice is between network functions R1 to FW1 and FW2</t></list>

      We will see in next example that in some scenarios this is not the case and the endpoints of 
      Transport Slice definition might be different from endpoints of its realization of transport slices. 
        </t>
        <t>
      It is very clear that regardless of how transport slice is realized in the network (i.e. using tunnels 
      of type RSVP or SR), the definition of transport slice 30 does not change at all but rather its realization.

        </t>
        <t><xref target="fig_Imple-SFC-Transport-NS-2"/> shows the realization of the transport slice 40 of 
      <xref target="fig_SFC-Transport-NS-2"/>. In this case the location of SF1 and SF2 has been explicitly decided by higher 
      level logic. In this case three transport slices 41, 42 and 43 will be created separately and eventually bind 
      together to form a single transport slice 40 to meet the SLA that delay is lower than 30 ms.
